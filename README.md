## Clean and Learn: Weakly-Supervised Learning for API QuestionAnswering


## Abstract

The development of a QA system for API documentation can greatlyfacilitate developers in API related tasks. Existing API QA systemsare trained with weakly-supervised tasks. That is, the golden an-swer can literally appear in multiple positions (i.e., start-end in-dices) in the documentation, though only one of them correctlysolve the question given its context. The other incorrect candidates(called spurious answers) can hinder the model to correctly learnthe golden answer.In this work, we perform an empirical study on the weakly su-pervised problem in API QA systems. We collect ApiQaData, a setof 200 API questions about Java from StackOverflow and find thatthe golden answers are often literally correlated to the originalquestion. Based on the empirical findings, we proposeClean andLearn, a novel API QA approach based on weakly-supervised learn-ing. To alleviate the impact of multiple occurrences of the goldenanswer, we design several scoring functions to rank the candidateoccurrences (clean). Only high quality (top-ùëò) candidate answersare involved for training. Then, we perform multi-task learning byweighing the losses computed from the top-koccurrences (learn).We evaluate our approach on the constructed ApiQaData dataset.The results show thatClean and Learnoutperforms state-of-the artapproaches, and can answer 141 out of 200 API-related questionsin ApiQaData


## Getting Started

1. Rename the dev set to test.jsonl.gz

2. Run split_data.py in code/src/preprocessor as follows:

```bash
python split_data.py \
    --source ../../../data/naturalQ/train.jsonl.gz \
    --train_output train.jsonl \
    --dev_output dev.jsonl \
    --data_type mrqa
```

4. Compress train.jsonl and dev.jsonl with gzip (gzip train.jsonl; gzip dev.jsonl)

5. Locate these two files into data/naturalQ/ directory

6. Now you have train/dev/test set in data/naturalQ directory


### Train BLANC with Clean and Learn on ApiQaData

Run BLANC script in code/ as follows:

```bash
LABEL=trial_001 GEOP=0.99 WINS=3 LMB=0.8 bash run_blanc_naturalqa.sh
```

### Test BLANC

Indicate which checkpoint you want to test.

In this case, we test BLANC with trial_001 checkpoint.

```bash
LABEL=trial_001 GEOP=0.99 WINS=3 LMB=0.8 bash run_blanc_naturalqa_test.sh
```
